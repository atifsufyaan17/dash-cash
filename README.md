# dash-cash
DashCash is an m-health application that rewards you with e-money for being fit. The money would be provided by health insurance companies, as by keeping their customers fit, we are decreasing the number of health claims and eventually saving them from paying lacs of rupees. DashCash will motivate people for being fit and additionally, will help insurance companies optimize their incurred ratio. As a first step, DashCash users have to select an insurance plan from a range of options provided. Based on the insurance plan and distance covered (measured through pedometer), they would be receiving incentives in their e-wallet. Users may use the app without opting for an insurance plan where they wouldn't be receiving any monetary benefits, just track of their fitness level. The implementation of ML in terms of recommending short-term/long-term goal settings and distance to be covered based on the user history leads to an all-round personalised customer-centric experience. We have developed the prototype of the application. This project has won 3rd prize at Innovation Challenge, Cognizance 2018, IIT Roorkee and was represented at Engineer's Conclave, Inter IIT Tech Meet, IIT Bombay and Google Mentorship Bootcamp, Google Hyderabad.
